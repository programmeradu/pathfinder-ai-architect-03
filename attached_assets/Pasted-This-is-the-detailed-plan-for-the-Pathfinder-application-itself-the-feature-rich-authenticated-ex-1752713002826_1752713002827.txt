This is the detailed plan for the "Pathfinder" application itself—the feature-rich, authenticated experience where users will manage their entire career journey.

The Vision: The "Pathfinder Career Cockpit"
Once a user logs in, they enter their personal Career Cockpit. This is not just a list of resources; it's an interactive dashboard designed for control, clarity, and motivation. The entire experience is built around a persistent sidebar for navigation and a main content area that displays the different sections of the application.

The Main Application Layout
Persistent Sidebar (Navigation): A clean, icon-based navigation bar on the left side of the screen. It will be collapsible and provide one-click access to the core features.

Icons for: Dashboard, Roadmap, AI Mentor, Portfolio, and Settings.

Main Content Area: A large, dynamic area where the selected feature is displayed.

Core Features & Component Breakdown
This is a detailed look at each section of the authenticated app.

1. The Dashboard (/dashboard) - Your Mission Control
Purpose: To provide a high-level overview of the user's progress and tell them exactly what they should focus on right now.

Key Features:

"Up Next" Card: A prominent card at the top that displays the single next learning resource from their roadmap, with a "Start Learning" button.

Weekly Goal Tracker: A visual progress ring or bar showing how close they are to completing their goals for the week (e.g., "3 of 5 resources completed").

"My Active Path" Summary: A small card showing their main goal (e.g., "Path: AI Engineer") and their overall completion percentage.

Recent Activity Feed: A chronological list of recent achievements (e.g., "You completed 'Understanding Transformers' yesterday!", "You earned a new milestone badge!").

Core Components: StatsCard.tsx, UpNextWidget.tsx, ActivityFeedItem.tsx, ProgressRing.tsx.

2. The Roadmap (/roadmap) - The Interactive Journey
Purpose: This is the heart of the application. It's the full, interactive visualization of the user's personalized learning curriculum.

Key Features:

Interactive Timeline/Skill Tree: A beautifully designed and animated visualization of their entire learning path. Users can pan, zoom, and explore.

Resource Nodes: Each step on the path is a clickable node. Clicking a node opens a modal or a side panel with the curated resource—embedding the YouTube video directly, showing a clean, reader-view of an article, or linking to a GitHub repo.

Progress Tracking: Each node has a checkbox. When a user marks a resource as complete, the UI provides satisfying feedback (e.g., the node lights up, a line connects to the next step) and the progress is saved to the Supabase database.

Milestone Banners: Major achievements (e.g., "You've Mastered the Foundations!") are marked with special banners or unlocks on the timeline.

Core Components: InteractiveTimeline.tsx, SkillNode.tsx, ResourceCard.tsx, MilestoneBanner.tsx.

3. The AI Mentor (/mentor) - Your Personal Guide
Purpose: A dedicated, persistent chat interface for the user to have an ongoing conversation with their Pathfinder AI mentor.

Key Features:

Full Conversation History: The chat interface loads the user's entire conversation history from our conversations table in Supabase.

Context-Aware Responses: The user can ask questions about their path ("Why is 'Linear Algebra' important for my goal?") and the AI will provide answers based on the context of their specific curriculum.

Voice-Enabled Interaction: A "mic" button will allow users to speak their questions, with the AI's response being played back using the ElevenLabs voice.

Smart Suggestions: The AI will proactively offer suggestions and encouragement, and provide clickable "quick reply" buttons to guide the conversation.

Core Components: ChatInterface.tsx, MessageBubble.tsx, SuggestionChip.tsx.

4. The Portfolio (/portfolio) - Showcase Your Skills
Purpose: To give users a tangible output for their learning. This is where they collect and showcase the projects they've built.

Key Features:

A grid of project cards that the user has added.

An "Add Project" feature that opens a modal where they can add a project title, a short description, a link to the GitHub repository, and a link to the live demo.

A shareable public URL (pathfinder.app/u/username) for their portfolio, which they can use on their resume or LinkedIn profile.

Core Components: ProjectCard.tsx, AddProjectModal.tsx.
