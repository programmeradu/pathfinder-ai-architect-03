I can see the issues! The console shows errors with React.Fragment and there's a problem with the InteractiveDemo component. I can also see that the Index.tsx is currently using the old InteractiveDemo instead of the EnhancedDemo. Let me fix these issues and create a stunning new hero section.

good job with the hero section, now update the header and logo to high standards, neat and beautiful.


amazing build with the new demo component as well but i thought it will be multi step like the previous one, and it should show both the learning path and career opportunities or life pathways after.. i want the demo to capture everything our app or project will offer.

now build a seperate version of this land page for mobile, fully optimised and full built to fit mobile screens, all components and elements must be built in the new seperate mobile specially to fit and be fully visible and usable on mobile screens.. site should auto detect the device and know which version to show whether mobile or desktop.

add another page or module to fully build a dark version of the landing page, colours and everything on point so that the colours wont invert and show ghost colours or very difficult to see elements.

I can see the issue clearly. The error "You cannot render a <Router> inside another <Router>" means there are multiple Router components in the app hierarchy. Let me analyze this step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the problem

I added a BrowserRouter in main.tsx
But there's likely already a Router somewhere else in the app (probably in App.tsx)
Step 2: Check the existing router setup

Read
src/App.tsx
Step 3: Understand the conflict Perfect! Now I see the issue clearly:

App.tsx already has a BrowserRouter (line 16)
main.tsx also has a BrowserRouter that I added
This creates nested routers, which React Router doesn't allow
Step 4: Fix the issue I need to remove the duplicate router from main.tsx and keep only the one in App.tsx, since that's where the routing logic belongs.

Edited
src/main.tsx
Perfect! I've resolved the router conflict. Here's what the problem was and how I fixed it:

The Problem:

The app had two BrowserRouter components:
One in main.tsx (that I accidentally added)
One in App.tsx (the original/correct one)
React Router doesn't allow nested routers, hence the error
The Solution:

Removed the duplicate BrowserRouter from main.tsx
Kept the routing logic in App.tsx where it belongs
Moved the ThemeProvider to wrap the entire app in main.tsx
The app should now work correctly without the router conflict error. The mobile detection and dark theme functionality will still work perfectly since the ThemeProvider is now properly positioned at the root level.
